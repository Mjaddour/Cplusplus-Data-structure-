# Cplusplus-Data-structure

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In the projects for this course, the main problem centered around efficiently splitting the input data into tokens, a fundamental step in data processing and analysis.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To address this challenge, I adopted a systematic approach. Recognizing the importance of data structures, I leveraged the vector data structure to assist me in the process of loading the tokens. By understanding how vectors work and their efficiency in handling sequences of data, I was able to implement a methodical solution to the problem.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Throughout the course of the activities and project, I encountered certain obstacles. To overcome these roadblocks, I adopted a two-pronged approach. First, I committed to a thorough revision of the relevant materials, ensuring a strong grasp of the concepts involved. Second, I dedicated time to deeply understanding the problem itself, which enabled me to find innovative solutions.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Engaging with this project has provided me with invaluable real-world experience in problem-solving. The project's practical nature exposed me to the complexities of working on challenges that mimic those encountered in professional scenarios. This exposure has expanded my approach to software design and program development by emphasizing the importance of not just theoretical knowledge, but also hands-on experience.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project has significantly evolved the way I approach writing programs. The emphasis on tackling a real-world problem has heightened my awareness of writing code that is not only functional but also maintainable, readable, and adaptable. Through this experience, I've learned the value of clear documentation, modular code design, and implementing best practices, all of which contribute to creating software that is robust and easily manageable in the long run.
